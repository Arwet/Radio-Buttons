# Radio-Buttons
This is my first try at designing radio buttons. It is not fully functional but  I am so proud of my progress so far. There are so many failed attempts that did not make it here. I am confident that the next time I design radio buttons I will  have improved  and rectified my mistakes. I will also focus more on my design components.
